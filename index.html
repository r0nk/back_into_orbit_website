Back Into Orbit is a indie rogue-like, currently in early beta. The game
centers around a robot trying to defeat a virus onboard his ship, in order to 
get back into orbit.

The game currently only runs on linux, but the plan is to get it running on 
Windows soon. If you buy the game during the beta, you'll get the full version
when it comes out.
